##
## Configuration for the GBS source service
##

[general]
## Repository cache directory.
## Default is '/var/cache/obs/gbs-repos/'
## You can configure the service to share the repository cache with the
## git-buildpackage service.
## You probably need to define if the service is run on the client side as
## the default directory is likely not accessible by regular users.
#repo-cache-dir = /var/cache/obs/git-buildpackage-repos/

## User and group
## The user and group under which gbs is run. The service itself is run under
## whatever user/group the source service server is configured to use - this
## user must have the privileges to set uid/gid if you configure these settings.
## You can give the user and group as name or uid/gid number directly.
#gbs-user = gbsservice
#gbs-group = gbsservice
